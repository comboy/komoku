# Komoku

**key value storage + time series database + pub sub**

Komoku is a key value database for different types of data, which keeps track of all changes, and then can compact historical data in a clever way. You can subscribe to different key changes.

For now the API is going to be compatible with ruby version (https://github.com/comboy/komoku) but after I migrate my home automation to the new system I'm going to update it. 

Why am I even writing this readme, it's way too early for that.
